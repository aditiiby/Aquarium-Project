# Aquarium Project

## About 
Aquarium is a modern puzzle game that requires a player to determine the water levels of a set of aquariums to collectively satisfy a number of constraints. 

![An example of the puzzle](https://github.com/aditiiby/Aquarium-Project/blob/main/Example.png)

The game takes place in square grids of spaces. Each aquarium is marked by thick red lines. The above puzzle has six aquariums.

Aquariums can be filled with air (red dots) or water (blue squares). Gravity acts down the screen. The player must not add water above air in any given aquarium.

The player must add water to each aquarium such that the number of water cells adds up to the column and row totals shown beside the puzzle board.
